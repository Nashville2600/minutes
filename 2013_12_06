Items:

1. Elections: (Held Verbally, no nay sayers)

● Jonnyx nominated and elected as President

● Andrew M. (need to look up his handle -ben) nominated and elected Vice 

President

● BenTheMeek nominated and elected Secretary

● No Treasurer volunteered, so Tilghman has agreed to remain on as interim until 

another candidate can be chosen and pass on his knowledge.

(The group was quite pleased with Amber’s experience and expertise in this area 

and view her favourably as a good replacement, but current by-laws are stopping 

this)

The meeting ended quickly due to approaching inclimate weather
